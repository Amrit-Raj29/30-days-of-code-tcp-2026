    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <h3>Experience & Achievements</h3>
    <p>
        I am a motivated undergraduate student with a growing interest in programming and problem-solving. I have gained
        hands-on experience by practicing C++ fundamentals, exploring Data Structures and Algorithms, and working with
        basic development tools like GitHub. Participating in coding challenges and academic projects has helped me
        build consistency, logical thinking, and debugging skills.
        <br>
        Alongside academics, I actively work on improving my technical foundation through self-learning, online
        resources, and regular practice. My key achievements include maintaining steady academic performance, completing
        structured coding challenges, and continuously improving my problem-solving approach. I am eager to learn,
        adapt, and apply my skills to real-world projects and collaborative environments.
