        Hi, I am Amrit Raj, a first year student and I am currently pursuing my B.Tech in Information Technology branch
        from NIT Raipur. I am originally from
        Aurangabad, Bihar. I am very curious about computers and technology, especially understanding how things work
        behind the scenes, which motivates me to keep learning and exploring new concepts.
